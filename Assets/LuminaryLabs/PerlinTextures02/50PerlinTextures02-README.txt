Introduction:
Thank you for choosing our 50 perlin particle textures pack.
These textures are versatile and can be used for a variety of effects. 
Our demo scene showcases some of our effects. Our package is compatible with URP and HDRP, there is a material associated with every texture for URP but only the textures are compatible with HDRP. 
While the demo scene uses default unity particle systems, these textures are Texture2D assets that can be used in the regular particle system, VFX graph, shaders and any other applicable use case.
